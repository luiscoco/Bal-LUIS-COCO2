[!] Changed the main icon of application.
[!] Revised the readme documentation. Thanks a lot to William Yates!
[!] Redesigned the About and Add/Edit Entry dialog windows.
[!] Now the settings, database and temporary files are being stored in the user application data folder. It solves the problem of running installable version on NT Windows systems from a non-admin user account.

[!] A few internal improvements.

1.5 (November 1, 2009)
[!] Enhanced compatibility with the latest Windows versions, Vista and Seven.
[!] Removed the Help button from the Add/Edit Entry window and from the Preferences dialog: there is no budget to build a complete help file in the nearest time.
[!] Improved bahaviour of the standard program messages.
[+] Status bar now shows the long version of hint message.
[!] Corrected a few typos in the various text labels.
[!] Added support for the latest DOSBox version 0.73. It doesn't store .conf in the installation dir anymore, so DOSShell learned detecting an actual path in the user directory.
